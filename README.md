# Tracking-Game
A simple game that can be used to improve your ability to track an object with the mouse.

# Controls
* Right-click to start or pause the game.
* Hold down the LEFT mouse button while tracking the blue circle.
* Esc to exit.

# Usage
* The goal is to keep the small red circle, representing the mouse cursor, inside the bigger blue circle while the LEFT mouse button is held down. 
* The bigger red circle will move left to right randomly. 
* The mouse control is inverted, to mimic how a target would move in an FPS game. 
* After 5 seconds, the game pauses and a score is displayed, representing the percentage of frames when the target was hit. The score is also recorded in a file called "score_history.txt"
